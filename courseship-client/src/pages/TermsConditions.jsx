          It is your responsibility to ensure that there is no material difference between the Job

          Any assignment(s) that you may give to Applicants to assess their suitability for the
          Job should be fair and relevant to the Job profile. Any attempt to get work done for
          free from Applicants disguised as assessment or to get them to download or generate
          downloads for your app or get likes/shares/comments etc. for your social media handles
          only for the purpose of getting free publicity disguised as an assignment are strictly

          as per agreed terms and conditions in the offer letter. Non payment of the remuneration
          or delayed payment of the remuneration is strictly prohibited and would invite suitable
